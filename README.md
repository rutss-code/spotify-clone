# My Spotify Clone

This is a simple front-end clone of Spotify, built just with HTML and CSS. I made it to practice my web development skills!

_This is the main desktop view of the Spotify clone._

## ‚ú® Features

- **Looks like Spotify:** I tried to match Spotify's dark theme and layout.
- **Side Bar:** Has the left sidebar with Home, Search, and Library.
- **main-Content:** Shows sections like "Recently played" and "Trending now."
- **music-player:** There's a basic player bar at the bottom.
