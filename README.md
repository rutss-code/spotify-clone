This is a simple front-end clone of Spotify, built just with HTML and CSS. I made it to practice and sharpen my web development skills!

## ‚ú® Features

- **Looks like Spotify:** I've carefully tried to match Spotify's iconic dark theme and overall layout to give it an authentic feel.
- **Side Bar:** Includes the familiar left sidebar with essential navigation links like "Home," "Search," and "Your Library."
- **Main Content:** Displays various content sections, such as "Recently played" and "Trending now," mimicking Spotify's content organization.
- **Music Player:** A basic player bar is present at the bottom, designed to resemble Spotify's music controls.
