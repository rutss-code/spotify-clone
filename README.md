# My Spotify Clone

This is a simple front-end clone of Spotify, built just with HTML and CSS. I made it to practice my web development skills!

*This is the main desktop view of the Spotify clone.*

## ‚ú® Features

* **Looks like Spotify:** I tried to match Spotify's dark theme and layout.
* **Navigation Bar:** Has the left sidebar with Home, Search, and Library.
* **Content Sections:** Shows sections like "Recently played" and "Trending now."
* **Player Bar:** There's a basic player bar at the bottom.
